                <p>I like this quote and I always try to live by it. I am a “simple man” if you ask me in single word. I am
                    always passionate to learn new things, whether its related to my profession or anything causal. I believe
                    a life’s most worth is to “experience” and cherish good things we have done.</p>
                <p>From last 12 years I am working in Information Technology(IT) field, started my career as a programmer to
                    currently managing a small dev team where we provide maintenance , development, support of various IT
                    applications over full SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).</p>
                <p>My programming skill set includes C, shell scripting, IBM Mainframe technologies - Cobol, Jcl, CICS, MQ based
                    xml services, Pacbase, Relation programming patterns, Rational develops tools ,Document generation tool
                    - Opentext Extreme. I have handful of working experience with both hierarchical legacy databases(IMS)
                    to relationship databases(IBM DB2). When it comes to soft skills , I have excellent understanding and
                    experience in various SDLC methods such as Waterfall and agile. Also I was part of all various SDLC life-cycles,
                    right from project start up phase to requirement gathering, estimation, design , develop, test deploy
                    and support.</p>
                <p>Besides work , I like sports movies and music. And I am always a big sports fan and have huge respect to
                    athletes and sports persons. They are my childhood heroes and my inspiration. I love cricket, soccer
                    , badminton & table tennis. Probably I would have chosen my field around sports, if it was not IT. I
                    come from a traditional Indian family and my hometown is
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam" target="_blank">Visakhapatnam</a>, and is one of the beautiful coastal area in Southern India. And other things that
                    interest me is people & culture and it's so fascinating to see and understand different cultures and
                    how each have their own way of doing.</p>
